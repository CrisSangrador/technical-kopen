# Technical Assesment for Kopen 👩🏻‍💻

This repository contains the technical assesment for Kopen. The instructions were as following: 

>>>Write a Python script that computes the amortization table of a mortgage.
>>>The start amount of the mortgage is 10000, and each month 375 is paid. Take in account that each 12 months (each year) an additional amount of 500 is paid. The mortgage has a monthly 0.5% interest rate, which is applied each month to the full amount due before the payment.
>>>The script should use variables, so if the amounts are changed adjusting them will make the same script work.
>>> For each month print:

>>>- The number of the month
>>>- The interest computed for the month
>>>- The due amount without interest
>>>- The due amount including the interest
>>>- The monthly paid

>>>As bonus point, create a CSV file with a row for each month including the values. Include a header on each column that includes the name of the field in the column.
