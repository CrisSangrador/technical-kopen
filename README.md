### Project description:

This project aims to calculate the amortization table for a mortgage, considering a monthly payment, interest rate, and additional payments made annually. 

### Contents:

This repository contains:

- A folder named `src`, where there's a file called `support.py` which contains the function designed to calculate the amortization of a mortgage.

- A file named `main.py`, where we import the function from `support.py` so we can use the mortgage amortization calculation in our main program.It also generates a `.csv` file with the amortization table data.

- A `.csv` file, which records the amortization calculation of our mortgage. 

### Technical stack
